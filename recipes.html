            <li>Make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk</li>
            <li>Roll out dough into a large rectangle</li>
            <li>Make the butter layer</li>
            <li>Enclose the butter layer inside the dough</li>
            <li>roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back together</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough again, fold it back together again</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together</li>

        <h3>Let's make the dough:</h3>
        <p>
            You will need butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk.
            Use cold milk, instead of warm milk!
            (Make sure at any point the dough becomes warm, STOP 
            and put it back in the fridge for abour 20-25 minutes!)
            Use a mixer to beat the dough for about 5 minutes. Cover it and
            then it rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
            Now you can take it out and roll the dought into a 14x10 inch rectangles 
            with a rolling pin.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Time for the butter!</h3>
        <p>
            Softened the butter and beat it with the flour. Then spread
            it into a rectangle and spread your butter to 7x10 inch rectangle, 
            around half of the length of the dough, and then chill it for ONLY 
            30 minutes. Once it's chilled, place it on the dough to laminate.
            Fit the butter nicely into the dough and fold the cold 
            dough over the cold butter. Seal it inside! Laminate the dough 3 times
            with a 30 minute break between the 2nd and 3rd time.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Last couple of steps:</h3>
        <p>
            Cover the rolled out, folded, and laminated dough (3 times) and chill it 
            for 4 hours or overnight. Roll out the dough one more time into a 8x20 inch rectange.
            Slice the rectangle down the center into two 4x20 inch rectangles and slice across to 
            create eight 4x5 inch rectanges. Slice the 8 rectangles you've made into 2 triangles.
            Use the rolling pin or your finger (which is easier to control) to stretch the triangles.
            Try not to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the bigger end of the triangle, 
            then tightly roll it up into beautiful crescent shapes (make sure the tip is underneath)!
            Rest them on the counter for about 1 hour and then in the refrigerator for another hour.
            [Allowing the croissants to be a cooler temperature going into the oven, it won't spread 
            as much, so if you're impatient you can just skip that step!] The croissants are ready!
            Brush them with a mixture of egg and milk. BAKE AND ENJOY!!! ðŸ¤¤
